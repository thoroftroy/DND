# DND
This is for things that help with my dungeons and dragons stuff
------------------------------------
Just some damage caclulations, maybe a boss fight or cataluoge later. Simply run the program from the terminal to use the program.
In linux type 'python3 locktester.py' or whatever the name of the program is.
In windows type 'python locktester.py' or whatever the name of the program is. 
Make sure that the terminal is open in the directory that the file is saved in or cd into it. 


Force Calculator
------------------------------------
This just calculates the force of an object using it's speed and weight. It's accuracy is probably not the best as I think I might be using some of the wrong calculations

Fat Damage Calculator
------------------------------------
Calculates the force and the amount of damage that a human being in DND 5e would deal if sprinting into an object using their weight and speed. Clearly this is a question that needed answering. 

Lock Tester
-----------------------------------
input any number of characters (ex 1498631, ee8fau31h, @#CYihW&^(*$) and then have someone else try and guess the password one character at a time, if they get anyhting wrong then it will reset to the begining of the password (this is just a simple combonation lock). Type 'exit' to leave the guessing halfway through, make sure to guess only one character at a time, currently it will always be wrong if you hit more than one character at a time even if you have the right passcode. 

Rand Lock Tester (Never gonna work)
-----------------------------------
Same as the lock tester but the lock is randomized, currently tells you the password and crashes on start so it doesn't work at all. This functionality is going to be added to the lock tester (it might already be there)

Loot Genorator
-----------------------------------
Type the number of chests you want to genorate and get randomized loot

Rigged Dice Roller
-----------------------------------
A simple dice roller that can be rigged if you so choose. This can be usefull if you want to cheese a roll to make things harder or easier for your players but still want a computer doing some of it. 
Type "roll" or "roll0" to roll a normal dice
Type "roll rigged" or "roll1" to roll a rigged dice (this will always be a somewhat high number)
Type "bad roll" or "roll2" to roll a rigged dice (this will always be a low number)
Type "clear" to clear the screen
