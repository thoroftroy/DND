# DND
This is for things that help with my dungeons and dragons stuff
------------------------------------
Just some damage caclulations, maybe a boss fight or cataluoge later


Force Calculator
------------------------------------
This just calculates the force of an object using it's speed and weight. It's accuracy is probably not the best as I think I might be using some of the wrong calculations

Fat Damage Calculator
------------------------------------
Calculates the force and the amount of damage that a human being in DND 5e would deal if sprinting into an object using their weight and speed. Clearly this is a question that needed answering. 

Lock Tester
----------------------------------
input a string of numbers 1-9 that is 9 didgets long and then type what your guesses are for it. If you get it wrong it crashes but you can go number by number to try and get the combo right. THis can be used for puzzles and things
