# DND
This is for things that help with my dungeons and dragons stuff
------------------------------------
Just some damage caclulations, maybe a boss fight or cataluoge later


Force Calculator
------------------------------------
This just calculates the force of an object using it's speed and weight. It's accuracy is probably not the best as I think I might be using some of the wrong calculations

Fat Damage Calculator
------------------------------------
Calculates the force and the amount of damage that a human being in DND 5e would deal if sprinting into an object using their weight and speed. Clearly this is a question that needed answering.
